	<h1>Problem Definition</h1>
	<p>It is worthwhile to predict how users would rate businesses based on past ratings or other implicit
		information that they offer up. These predictions could be used to serve more relevant content, improving
		user appreciation, but also driving revenue. In this case, we analyze a subset of Yelp datasets consisting
		of users and implicit information, business information, and a partial list of explicit ratings and reviews,
		which serves as a training set. Given other user-business combinations, our goal is to predict how those 
	users would rate those businesses. </p>
	<p>Such an undertaking requires algorithmic analysis of data. The first step is to preprocess our features
		and transform them into formats conducive to model use and speed. This requires basic understanding of how
		models work and their requirements, as well as efficient methods to manipulate large amounts of data. Next, 
		using our intuition and understanding of the data, we must make informed choices about the models and 
		hyperparameters used. We should also design visualizations to help us achieve better understanding of 
	relations implicit in the data. </p>
